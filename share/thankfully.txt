Thankfully

The ants float to the surface of your coffee or your water,
And chiggers float away when you rinse your rice.
Mosquitoes are slow as shit.
Monsoon rains cool the place and mostly fall at night.
The crickets -- or whatever they are,  
Alls I know is they're loud as fuck --
The crickets get confused by clouds
And start their vespers early, 
Then realize their mistake and stop on a dime.
People only mark you for death if you give them a reason.
The cat cleans himself, lets bullfrogs be, 
And doesn't understand my problems.
A fruit's season ends when you can't look at another one:
Desires decline with opportunities.
Books and such are patient, 
And poems take their own sweet time.
