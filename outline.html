<h2>Outline</h2>
<p>
  I am currently using a desktop application, <a href="http://treeline.bellz.org/" target="_blank">TreeLine</a>, to edit my outline.  I need to write a script to transform the data from this outline into a set of html pages.  I expect to have this done in short order, at which point I will post the outline here.
