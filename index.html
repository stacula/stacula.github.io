<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>
  This web site is intended to be a place for me to informally publish
  some work-in-progress that I've been doing on Marcel Proust's monumental
  novel In Search of Lost Time.  This work consists of:
  <ul>
    <li>An extremely detailed conceptual outline. With over 2,000 nodes it still only covers about the first 2/3 of Swann's Way.</li>
    <li>Some annotations to the text based on an online reading group I organized in 2009-10.  I plan to add many more of my own annotations.</li>
    <li>Some unfinished essays and fragments, including my undergraduate thesis on Proust.</li>
  </ul>
  I will use this web site as a place to publish the fist two of these.
