<h2>Masturbation passage from Contre Saint-Beauve</h2>

<p>Proust, Marcel. 1984. <i>Marcel Proust On Art And Literature</i>. Trans. Sylvia Townsend Warner. New York: Carroll and Graf. pp 29-31.</p>

<p>And there are other senations belonging to the years gone by, that also come back only in dreams and, unpoetical though they may be, bring with them all the poetry of youth -- just as there is nothing so full of the sound of Easter churchbells and the first violets as those last cold days of winter which spoil our holidays and compel us to light the fire before midday.  I would not venture to speak of these sensations which from time to time revisited me in sleep if they had not then seemed almost poetic, totally irrelevant to my present self, and colourless as those aquatic flowers whose roots are not attached to earth.  La Rochefoucauld said that only our first loves are involuntary.  So is it, too, with those pleasures taken in solitude, which later on we only make use of to pass off the absence of a woman, imagining to ourselves that She is with us.  But when I was twelve years old, and for the first time, going upstairs to the top floor of our house at Combray, locked myself into the water-closet with its dangling garlands of orris root, it was an unknown pleasure that I went in search of, sufficient in itself and not a substitute for anything else.</p>

<p>It was an unusualy spacious room for a water-closet.  The door locked securely, but the window always stood open to accommodate a young lilac which having taken root in the outside wall had pushed its scented head through the aperture.  So far aloft, in the attics of the house, I was completely alone, but this element of being out of doors added a delicious uneasiness to the sense of security which those sturdy bolts assured to my solitude.  Then, in search of a pleasure that I did not know, I began to explore myself, and if I had been engaged in performing a surgical operation on my brain and marrow I could not have been more agitated, more terrified. I believed at every moment that I should die.  But what of that? -- my consciousness, exalted by pleasure, knew itself to be wider and more powerful than the universe which I saw remotely through the window, a universe in whose immensity and duration my everyday thoughts were resigned to claiming no more than a gnat's share.  Far as the forest might stretch and the clouds round themselves above it, I felt that my spirit extended a little further, was not quite filled by it, had still a littlel margin to spare.  I felt the lovely swelling hillsides that rose like breasts on either side of the river supported, like mere insubstantial reflections, on the dominating store of my pupils.  All this world reposed on me, and I was more than it, and could not die.  I paused to draw breath.  Wishing to sit down without being incommoded by teh sun which was shining full on the seat I quoted to it: "'Take yourself off, my boy, to make room for me;'" [<i>Ote-toi de l√†, mon petit, que je m'y mette.</i> A catchword, dating from the French Revolution] and I drew the curtains, though the lilac bough prevented me from shutting the window.  At last a shimmering jet arched forth, suport after spurt, as when the fountain at Saint-Cloud begins to play -- which we can recognise (since there is a personality in the untiring flow of its waters that their unyielding curve gracefully, incessantly, portrays) in the portrait Hubert Robert made of it, only there the admiring crown had [gap in manuscript] which speckle the old master's picture with little seedpods, pink, reddened, or black.</p>

<p>In that moment I felt a sort of caress surrounding me. It was the scent of lilac-blossom, which in my excitement I had grown unaware of.  But a bitter smell, like the smell of sap, was mixed with it, as thought I had snapped the branch.  I had left a trail on the leaf, silvery and natural as a thread of gossamer or a snail-track, that was all.  But on that bough, it seemed to me like the forbidden fruit on the Tree of Knowledge; and like the races that give non-human forms to their deities, for some time afterward it was in the guise of this almost interminably extensible silvery thread which I had to spin out of myself by going widdershins to the normal course of my life that I pictured the devil.</p>

<p>Despite that smell of a broken branch and that smell of wetted linen, it was the gentle lilac-scent that prevailed.  It came to me as familiarly as when I went to play in the park on the outskirts of the town, where, even before one caught sight of the white gate with its lilac trees nearby, swaying their plumed heads and supple frames like elderly ladies who still preserve the mannered graces of their youth, the lilac-scent came to meet us, welcoming us to the path that led upstream beside the river...</p>
